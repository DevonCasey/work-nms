# work-nms

A simple tool that runs on a spare workstation that screams at me when it can't ping an IP. Why? OpenNMS is broken at my job currently.

Pulls in a list of IP addresses and Names from a .csv. The csv has only those two columns i.e.
| Name | IP |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Google | 8.8.8.8 |
